              <h3><u>Description:</u></h3>
		            <p class="indent">This assignment creates an ePortfolio, which will contain all the assignemnts done throughout the semester. Also an "About Me" page, which talks about the past, present, and future of the web developer, his/her favorite website, academic history, professional aspirations, a schedule for the courses they are enrolled in for the current semster, and how you can contact the author.</p>
                <p class="indent"> This assignment has taught and refreshed me about the basic fundamentals of HTML and CSS. For example, when creating the two pages, I refreshed my memory about all the ample of HTML elemnts. It has taught me that if we used a single CSS page it would keep all the pages in uniform which is very nice.</p>
              <h3><u>Objectives:</u></h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Become familiar with basic HTML elements, including tables, lists, paragraphs, etc. in the creation of static web pages</li>
                  <li>Become familiar with basic CSS elements which include using the dot/class concept on certain parts of the HTML</li>
                  <li>Understand how CSS can be use to both standardize and simplify static web pages using HTML</li>

            <p><b><u><a href="assign2/index.html">Assignment 2: JavaScript Creating a Form</a></u></b></p>
              <h3><u>Description:</u></h3>
                <p class="indent"> This assignment was to create a webpage using widgets with JavaScript to collects some information from the user and based of the information to make decisions, and provide the user with feedback. For the website, we were free to do anything we wanted as long as there was the following:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Textboxes to collect free form information</li>
                  <li>Radio buttons to collect one option among many</li>
                  <li>Check boxes to collect many options among many</li>
                  <li>Drop down boxes to collect many options among many</li>
                  <li>A reset button option</li>
                  <li>A submit button option that will call an event</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="indent">For my webpage, I decided to go with an online coffee order form where you enter your first name, last name, contact number, and email. Then you can pick what type of coffee you would like. (i.e. Coffee, Espresso, Macchiato, Chemex, etc.) You then pick what size you would want the coffee in then, which beans to use from light, medium, dark, and decaf roast. Lastly, if you would like an extra shot, almond/soy milk, handmade syrups, and/ or honey. Also there is an text area where you can add an comment or a specific instruction for how would you like your coffee. </p>
                <p class="indent"> This assignment has taught and refreshed me about the basics fundamentals of JavaScript. The big and main thing for me was creating the scripts because you have to type it exactly how you named it or it would not work and you have to type it a certain way.</p>
              <h3><u>Objectives:</u></h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Become familiar with different type of JavaScript widgets. (i.e. checkboxes, radio buttons, text area, and as well as a scroll down box</li>
                  <li>Become familiar with creating scripts, function, and variables for JavaScript to do certain actions when hitting a submit or reset button</li>
                  <li>All understanding how CSS and JavaScript interact with each other when working with the textboxes, radio buttons, check boxes, drop down boxes, and the reset and submit button</li>
                 </ul>
          </li>

            <p><b><u><a href="assign3/index.html">Assignment 3: Intermediate Client-Side Programming with JavaScript</a></u></b></p>
              <h3><u>Description:</u></h3>
                <p class="indent">For the third assignment, it further covers JavaScript. The purpose of the assignment is to take user input, a list of numbers, and perform multiple mathematical computations on the list. This assignment also pointed out the advantages and efficiency of designing code for reusability. Many of the calculations used a simpler computation as part of it.</p>
                <p class="indent">For this assignment, it has taught me how to use code both modularity and reusability in order for me to use the same code for the summation, mean, median, mode, variance of sample, and standard deviation of samples. I had to make use of the patterns by having one function call another function to do intermediate processing.</p>
              <h3><u>Objectives:</u></h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Knowing how to implement the function into code to perform mathematical computations</li>
                  <li>Efficiency of designing code for reusability</li>
                  <li>Goals of software development include both modularity and reusability</li>
                </ul>

              <h3><u>Description:</u></h3>
                <p class="indent">For the fourth assignment, I have to create an animation of a concept. The topic could have been anything that I was interested in from my prior academic, personal or professional experiences. The animation of a concept should involve a topic that requires a higher level of cognition.</p>
                <p class="indent">For this assignment, it has taught me how to use HTML 5 Canvas with JavaScript to create the animation. I also learned how to use Fabric JavaScript as well as JQuery.</p>
              <h3><u>Objectives:</u></h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Introduction to HTML 5 Canvas, Drawing, and Animations</li>
                  <li>Be able to create an animation of a concept</li>

              <h3><u>Description:</u></h3>
                <p class="indent">For the fifth assignment, I  learned the basics of PHP and we had to create a simple login manager and as well as a stock portfolio manager. The services that was required for the stock profolio manager was too add, modify, and delete a stock from your portfolio. </p>
                <p class="indent">I thought this was a really fun assignment because we were able to create a log in manager because I always wonder how they create a log in. It is very different from client-side programming and I feel like server-side programming is really fun and interesting.</p>
              <h3><u>Objectives:</u></h3>
                <ul>
		  <li>Understand the basics to Server-Side programming with PHP</li>
                  <li>Create simple login manager that requests a username and password and validates the information</li>
                  <li>Create a stock portfolio manager using PHP which allows the user to add, modify, and delete stocks</li>
                </ul>

              <h3><u>Description:</u></h3>                
		<p class="indent">For the sixth  assignment, I learned the basics of database technology used in conjunction with server-side technology commonly used on the Web. There was five parts that needed to be done:</p>				<ol>
                  <li>Create a simple table in MySQL to store data about something</li>
                  <li>Create a web application that will alow a user to input records into this table using PHP or JSP and a SQL insert</li>
                  <li>Create a web application that will alow a user to remove records from this table using PHP or JSP and a SQL delete</li>
                  <li>Crate a web application that will alow a user to update records within this table using PHP or JSP and a SQL update</li>
                  <li>Modify your code so that the users of this site connot potentially damage your database structure by thwarting SQL injection</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="indent">I felt this was one of the hardest assignments because we had to integrate PHP and MySQL. Even though it was a hard assignment, I did enjoy finguring it out and solving the problems that I faced. This assignment took me the longest.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Understand how to integrate to Server-Side programming with PHP and MySQL</li>

              <h3><u>Description:</u></h3>                
    <p class="indent">For the seventh and last assignment, I learn the basics of AJAX. This was the easiest and smallest assignment that was assigned. Using the table that we created in assignment 6, I created a small AJAX application that will filter the responese based on the user action. In my case, it filtered the departments from computer science, information technology, information systems, and information science.</p>

                <p class="indent">I felt this was one of the easiest assignment because it was a small AJAX application that only required a few lines of codes, most of the work done was from assignment 6.</p>
              <h3><u>Objectives:</u></h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Understand the basics of AJAX</li>
                  <li>Learning how to filter using AJAX, JavaScript, and XML</li>
