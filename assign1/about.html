        <h3>About</h3>
        <p class="indent">	Andy Nguyen was born in Santa Monica, California in 1992. He is the only boy and youngest with five sisters. After briefly living in Santa Monica, Andy and his family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he spent most of his childhood years. When Andy and his family went on a trip to Florida to visit other family members, they made the decision to move to Jacksonville, Florida. Andy attended Bishop Kenny High School where he developed a strong interest with computers. He took several computer classes and realized he had a natural talent in programming using Visual Basics, C++, and HTML with CSS.</p>
	<p class="indent">	Andy is currently a senior at the University of North Florida pursuing his Bachelor in Computer and Information Science with a concentration in Computer Science. When Andy has free time he enjoys taking care of his Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Dexter. Dexter is one crazy dog but helps Andy through the day when he is stressed or overwhelmed with schoolwork. Andy is also a coffee fanatic with his collection of different brewing methods through his Chemex, Aeropress, Kalita Wave, and his favorite Rancilio Silvia espresso machine.</p>
	<p class="indent">	Andy is hoping to find the best internship for his last semester in college. His plan is to gain as much experience through his internship and to get his foot in the door into the computer world. His main goal is to take his talent and achievements to the west coast and work for Fortune 500 companies like Apple, Microsoft, and/or Google. </p>
